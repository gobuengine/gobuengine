## 2D cross-platform game engine

**[Gobu Engine](https://godotengine.org) is a cross-platform game engine designed for creating 2D games, and in the near future, 3D games as well.** Currently, games can only be exported for the Windows platform, but support for other essential platforms, including Linux, macOS, HTML5, Android, iOS, as well as web-based platforms and consoles, is planned in the near future.
