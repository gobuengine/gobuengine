[Gobu Engine](https://gobuengine.org) Gobu2D is innovative software for creating 2D games in a simple and accessible way. It is being developed in C and GTK4, focusing on providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

## Free, Open Source
Hello everyone! I’ve decided to make a change to the licenses for our projects to better align with each one’s vision.

- GobuEditor will move to the GPLv3+ license, ensuring that this editor maintains a free software philosophy, promoting open collaboration and code sharing.

- GobuPlatform, on the other hand, will continue under the MIT license, providing flexibility for use in both open-source and commercial projects.

With this combination of licenses, I want to make sure that GobuEngine remains accessible and that each part of the project supports its purpose. Thank you for your ongoing support and for being part of this community!
